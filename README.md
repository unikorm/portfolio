# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio and will be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Technologies I used

I used JavaScript and React with some of its newest features, such as React Router v6, Context, and more. For styling, I used basic CSS, and I might consider using TailWindCSS in the future. For animations, I used Framer Motion. In the coming days, I plan to work on a secret page
