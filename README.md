# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio and will be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Technologies I used

I used JavaScript and React with some of its newest features, such as React Router v6, Context, and more. For styling, I used basic CSS, and I might consider using TailWindCSS in the future. For animations, I used Framer Motion. In the coming days, I plan to work on a secret page with game and maybe more. Then i plan it make in NEXT.js to learn it on this and make it faster and more ready to work with kind of databases or other data storages from when i will retrive some data.
